# react-around-api-full
The API of "Around the U.S." with authorization and registration handled by the back-end server.

This repository contains the full API of "Around the U.S." project that features user authorization and user registration and handles cards and users. Please add to this readme:
* a link to repository with the complete React application which uses this API;
* a link to the website that hosts your API.

FIXME Please provide the URL for the public domain in the readme.

COMPLETE I would recommend storing logs in a separate logs folder, not in the main directory. It will keep the project clean and easy to navigate.

FIXME (OPTIONAL) https://snipboard.io/4PlGjp.jpg The JWT_SECRET secret key is hardcoded in different places. Better to take the secret key from env variables or import the value from the config file.
